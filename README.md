# Environment setup
I am currently using the Atom editor which allows me to use plugins to auto compile my code.

I am using the `sass-autocompile` plugin:
https://atom.io/packages/sass-autocompile

All that's needed to run this program is the node-sass npm package. To install this package run the following:
`npm i -g node-sass`

If you are not using Atom then you should use this command:

NOTE: First make sure to cd to the correct directory, or include the directory path in the command.

`sass style.scss style.css`
